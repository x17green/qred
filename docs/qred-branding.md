This is a critical step, as color psychology plays a huge role in how users perceive a financial app. A good color palette can build trust, create visual hierarchy, and make the app a pleasure to use.

Here are three distinct, sleek, and unique branding color palettes for **Qred**, all designed to follow the 60/30/10 rule.

### Understanding the 60-30-10 Rule for Your App

*   **60% Primary:** The main background color. This is what the user sees most. It should be neutral and easy on the eyes to ensure text is readable and the user isn't overwhelmed.
*   **30% Secondary:** The color for "containers" or secondary surfaces like cards, headers, and bottom navigation bars. This color adds depth and is often where the main brand color lives.
*   **10% Accent:** The "action" color. Used for buttons, links, selected icons, and important notifications. It must have high contrast to stand out and guide the user's eye.

### Palette 1: "Modern Trust"

This palette is clean, professional, and inspires confidence, blending the classic trustworthiness of blue with an energetic, modern green for action.

#### **60% Primary (Backgrounds)**
*   **Light Mode:** White (`#FFFFFF`)
*   **Dark Mode:** Deep Charcoal (`#121212`)

#### **30% Secondary (Cards, Headers, Nav)**
*   **Brand Color: Qred Navy (`#1A2A4D`)**
    *   A deep, serious navy blue that feels secure and stable. It's dark enough to be sophisticated but has enough color to not feel like black.
    *   **In Light Mode:** Used as the background for cards or the header.
    *   **In Dark Mode:** Used for subtle highlights or as a slightly lighter surface than the main background.

#### **10% Accent (Buttons, Links, Active States)**
*   **Action Color: Success Green (`#00E676`)**
    *   A vibrant, almost neon green that signifies "money," "go," and "success." It has excellent contrast against both white and the deep navy, making it perfect for call-to-action buttons like "Pay Now."

#### **Neutrals (Text & Borders)**
*   **Text:** Light Gray (`#E0E0E0`) on dark backgrounds, Dark Gray (`#333333`) on light backgrounds.
*   **Borders/Dividers:** A subtle, darker shade of the primary background.

**Why it works:** This is a classic FinTech combination for a reason. It feels safe and reliable while the bright green accent makes it feel modern and efficient. It says "your money is safe, and we get things done fast."

### Palette 2: "Sophisticated Growth"

This palette is more unique and brand-forward. It uses a deep, calming green to suggest wealth and growth, paired with a premium amber for a touch of class.

#### **60% Primary (Backgrounds)**
*   **Light Mode:** Off-White / Linen (`#F7F7F7`)
*   **Dark Mode:** Near Black (`#161616`)

#### **30% Secondary (Cards, Headers, Nav)**
*   **Brand Color: Lender Green (`#0D3D32`)**
    *   A very deep, muted forest green. It’s calming, sophisticated, and associated with prosperity without being cliché. It feels grounded and trustworthy.
    *   **In Light Mode:** Provides a rich, high-contrast background for cards.
    *   **In Dark Mode:** Can be used for headers or elements that need to stand out slightly.

#### **10% Accent (Buttons, Links, Active States)**
*   **Action Color: Amber Gold (`#FFC107`)**
    *   A rich, warm amber-gold. It feels premium and valuable. It contrasts beautifully with the deep green, creating a visually appealing and unique look that stands apart from competitors.

#### **Neutrals (Text & Borders)**
*   **Text:** Soft Black (`#212121`) on light backgrounds, Off-White (`#F7F7F7`) on dark backgrounds.
*   **Borders/Dividers:** Light Gray (`#E0E0E0`)

**Why it works:** This palette positions Qred as a premium, thoughtful brand. It's less "tech startup" and more "trusted financial partner." The green/gold combination is memorable and feels both organic and valuable.

### Palette 3: "Minimalist & Bold"

This palette focuses on a clean, minimalist, monochrome base, allowing a single, powerful accent color to define the entire brand identity. It's confident and unapologetically modern.

#### **60% Primary (Backgrounds)**
*   **Light Mode:** White (`#FFFFFF`)
*   **Dark Mode:** True Gray (`#1C1C1E`) - A common iOS dark mode color.

#### **30% Secondary (Cards, Headers, Nav)**
*   **Brand Color: Light Gray / Darker Gray**
    *   **Light Mode:** A very light gray (`#F2F2F7`).
    *   **Dark Mode:** A slightly lighter shade of the primary (`#2C2C2E`).
    *   The goal here is for the secondary color to be extremely subtle, creating depth through shades of gray rather than a strong color.

#### **10% Accent (Buttons, Links, Active States)**
*   **Action Color: Qred Magenta (`#E4007C`)**
    *   A vibrant, bold magenta. This is an unexpected choice for a financial app, which makes it incredibly unique and memorable. It conveys confidence, energy, and innovation. It will make every button and interactive element pop with purpose.

#### **Neutrals (Text & Borders)**
*   **Text:** Almost Black (`#111111`) on light, almost white (`#FAFAFA`) on dark.
*   **Borders/Dividers:** A slightly darker shade of the secondary color.

**Why it works:** This palette is for a brand that wants to be seen as a disruptor. The minimalist base makes the app feel incredibly clean and easy to navigate, while the magenta accent creates a powerful and unforgettable brand identity. It's bold, sleek, and very "now."
