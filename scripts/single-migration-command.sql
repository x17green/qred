-- Enhanced Debt Management Database Migration - Single Command Block

-- Step 1: Add new columns
ALTER TABLE "Debt" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "debtorName" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "Payment" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "recordedBy" UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Step 2: Add documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN "Debt"."debtorName" IS 'Custom name for the debtor, used for better identification when available';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "Payment"."recordedBy" IS 'User ID of who recorded this payment (lender or system)';

-- Step 3: Update RLS policies for Payment table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert payments for their debts" ON "Payment";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view payments for their debts" ON "Payment";

-- Step 4: Create performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_debt_debtor_name" ON "Debt" USING gin(to_tsvector('english', "debtorName"));
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_debt_debtor_name_lower" ON "Debt" (lower("debtorName"));

-- Instructions for next steps:
-- 1. If you see ‚úÖ symbols above, the migration was successful
-- 2. Run 'npm run test:enhanced-debts' in your terminal to test all features
-- 3. Test the mobile app with: onboard@qred.com / password123
-- 4. The test data can be safely deleted once testing is complete
-- 5. If any step failed, check the error messages and re-run specific sections
